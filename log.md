##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've started on the Web Development 101 course on the [Odin Project]((https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav#null).

**Thoughts** I've had quite a good refresher on the basics of HTML & CSS. Had a recap on form input elements, and centering content with CSS while recreating the Google Homepage.

**Made a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript**

**Thoughts** Took a while to get into the switch statements. A good refresher on variables, numbers, strings, conditionals and loops. Definitely need to do more on functions.
