##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've started on the Web Development 101 course on the Odin Project.

**Thoughts** I've had quite a good refresher on the basics of HTML & CSS. Had a recap on form input elements, and centering content with CSS while recreating the Google Homepage.
